## 🖌️ Logo

To create the logo with Piggy I used the resource pack from [The Mobo](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/muddy-pigs-datapack/) I imported it into [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/) then exported it to a GLTF template and imported into [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) then exported and edited with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) to make 2 versions one for discord and one general
