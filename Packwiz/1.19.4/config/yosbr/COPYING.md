Requirements if you are distributing any assets made by me:

1. Give clear credit in an appropriate place (e.g. video descriptions, pack.mcmetas, listing descriptions).
2. Link back to pack's page on PlanetMinecraft, Modrinth, CurseForge(You can find all tree links in separate file).
3. Do not monetise under any circumstances, including use of link shorteners. Any content with assets made by me must be entirely free and open sourced, to uphold my standards. This includes redistribution on the Bedrock Marketplace or locking behind a paywall (e.g. Patreon). Taking voluntary donations or participating in reward programs (e.g. CurseForge points, YouTube monetization) is allowed.

You must abide by the above rules if you are doing any of the following:

1. Distributing my assets in any form, modified or not.
2. Using my textures as placeholders.
3. Using my textures as a base for any of your own textures that you're making public.
4. Using a few textures that you cannot properly make yourself (e.g. paintings).
5. Distributing a modified copy as a content creator with your videos/streams.
6. Using textures for adventure maps, server resource packs, mod textures, or data packs.

Exceptions:

1. If you're doing anything privately and undistributed to my assets (e.g. custom edit for personal use, unpublished add-ons, mod support, using the pack for a small private Minecraft server, or edits either by you or from different packs) you can safely disregard all of these requirements since you are not gaining unfairly from me in any form.

  0.2. "Normal Usage" means usage of The Pack as intended for the general

and conditions detailed below.


                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.
  
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Project" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees", "users" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  "The Author" refers to the original creator of this project and it's
source code. 

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Project or a work based
on the Project.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement
under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or
modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution
(with or without modification), making available to the public, and in
some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a
computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.


  1. Redistribution

  Public propagation of this project or parts of it requires you to

however require explicit permission by the author of the original project.
  See section 3 for more information about public modifications.


  3. Public Modifications

  Public redistribution of a modified version of this project requires
explicit permission from the original author. In order for the
modification to be applicable for this it has to contain a certain amount
of original work by the user. This modified version has to use the same
license as the original project.
  Furthermore the original project and its author have to be clearly
credited. Any means of monetization through this modified version is
strictly prohibited unless explicit permission by the original project's
author is given.


  4. Usage of parts of this project as part of another, original project

  Using parts of this projects source code as part of another, original
project requires explicit permission from this projects author.
  Furthermore this project, its author and the parts used have to be
clearly credited. Additionally any means of monetization on this modified
version are prohibited unless explicit permission is given.


  5. Liability

  The project is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express
or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability,
fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. In no event shall the
author or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other
liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from,
