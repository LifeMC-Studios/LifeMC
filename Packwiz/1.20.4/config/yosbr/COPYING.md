2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *

*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
steward.

create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
such modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary

Author @AmongstReality(https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/amongstreality/)

Requirements if you are distributing any assets made by me:

1. Give clear credit in an appropriate place (e.g. video descriptions, pack.mcmetas, listing descriptions).
2. Link back to pack's page on PlanetMinecraft, Modrinth, CurseForge(You can find all tree links in separate file).
3. Do not monetise under any circumstances, including use of link shorteners. Any content with assets made by me must be entirely free and open sourced, to uphold my standards. This includes redistribution on the Bedrock Marketplace or locking behind a paywall (e.g. Patreon). Taking voluntary donations or participating in reward programs (e.g. CurseForge points, YouTube monetization) is allowed.

You must abide by the above rules if you are doing any of the following:

1. Distributing my assets in any form, modified or not.
2. Using my textures as placeholders.
3. Using my textures as a base for any of your own textures that you're making public.
4. Using a few textures that you cannot properly make yourself (e.g. paintings).
5. Distributing a modified copy as a content creator with your videos/streams.
6. Using textures for adventure maps, server resource packs, mod textures, or data packs.

Exceptions:

1. If you're doing anything privately and undistributed to my assets (e.g. custom edit for personal use, unpublished add-ons, mod support, using the pack for a small private Minecraft server, or edits either by you or from different packs) you can safely disregard all of these requirements since you are not gaining unfairly from me in any form.

FAITHFUL LICENSE
Version 3 - 20th February 2023

Copyright ¬© Faithful Resource Pack


You may do the following:


1: Use our work as placeholders.

2: Use our work as a base or reference for your own content (e.g. modded textures, content creator edits).

3: Use a few textures that you cannot properly make, such as painting or particle textures.

4: Distribute a modified copy of a pack as a content creator with your videos or streams.

5: Use our work for adventure maps, server resource packs, mod textures, or data packs.


By doing any of the above, you agree to follow these requirements:


1: Give clear credit in an appropriate place (e.g. video descriptions, pack.mcmetas, listing descriptions).

2: Link back to our website, which you can find here:
	https://faithfulpack.net/

3: Don't take credit for work you didn't make and always give proper attribution to any work you use or modify. In addition, try to be somewhat specific about what you're using, as "GUI originally from Faithful 32x" works a lot better than "some textures from Faithful". Just be honest about what you're using, use common sense when in doubt, and you'll be fine.

4: Do not monetize content that contains any of our work, modified or not, under any circumstances. This includes locking your content behind a paywall (including the Minecraft Marketplace) or monetizing download links. Taking voluntary donations is still allowed, but if it feels like you're profiting off our work don't do it.

5: Don't make your projects look official when they aren't. Examples of this behavior would include copying our branding or marking a project as "official" in a way that would confuse the average viewer into believing a project is official when it isn't.

6: This file, unmodified, must be included in any content which contains any of our work.


Exceptions:


1: If you're doing anything privately or undistributed to our work (e.g. custom edit for personal use, unpublished add-ons, mod support, personal Minecraft server resource pack, or edits either by you or from different packs) you can safely disregard all of these requirements since you are not gaining unfairly from us in any form.

2: Projects not directly related to textures (e.g. website, bot) may have separate licenses with different terms. Check their respective pages or repositories for more information. If nothing is mentioned, assume that all rights remain reserved.

3: If you are using textures made before March 2016 (Minecraft Release 1.9). These textures are licensed under Vattic's original Faithful 32x32 license, which has different requirements compared with this license. If you're interested, you can find the original license here under "Usage Guidelines":
	https://web.archive.org/web/20150607220656/http://www.minecraftforum.net:80/forums/mapping-and-modding/resource-packs/1223254-faithful-32x32-pack-update-red-cat-clay-1-8



We reserve the right to:


1: Refuse the ability to use, distribute, or modify any work made by us for any person or group. This action would be final, generally only in the case of unusual circumstances.

2: Take legal action if you do not comply with these guidelines.

3: Change this license at any time for any reason.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.
  
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of

(with or without modification), making available to the public, and in
some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a
computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

license as the original project.
  Furthermore the original project and its author have to be clearly
credited. Any means of monetization through this modified version is
